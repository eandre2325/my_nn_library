# My NN Library

This is a personal project where I'm building a neural network library from scratch in Python as part of my journey in learning machine learning. The purpose of this library is to implement and experiment with various techniques that I am learning in my ML course.

## Current Features

- Dense (fully connected) layers
- Various Activation Functions
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
- Cross Entropy loss

## Future Implementations

I plan to implement additional features as I continue learning, including:

- Dropout regularization
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Additional optimization techniques

## Why This Project?

This project is a work in progress and is primarily intended as a learning tool. I am implementing everything from scratch without relying on high-level libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow (except for loading data), so that I can fully understand the underlying mechanics of neural networks.

## How to Use

Since this library is for educational purposes, itâ€™s not optimized for performance and may lack some of the features found in production-ready ML frameworks. Feel free to clone the repository and experiment with the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_nn_library.git
